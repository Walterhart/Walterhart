### Hi my name is Walter Hart Jr

 I am a recent graduate of The University of Akron with a degree in Computer Science - Systems. Currently, I work as a Web Developer and Technical Support Personnel at 3C Digital Media Network. My expertise lies in working with frameworks such as vanilla JavaScript, React, and Angular for the front-end, and I have experience in making APIs using Node.js for the back-end. Additionally, I am proficient in programming languages such as C++, Python, and SQL. I have also worked with machine learning and AI algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vectors, Neural Nets, KNN, MDP, and Reinforce Learning. I am passionate about constantly learning new frameworks and technologies to stay up-to-date with industry developments. In my spare time, I am currently expanding my knowledge of Linux and learning Vue.js. If you have any questions  please feel free to reach out to me at wally@walterhart.net.

Fun fact: I love learning and interacting with animals.  I like animals such as dogs, cats, snakes, tarantulas, chickens, rabbits, and chinchillas.  My favorite animal is the penguin. I find it funny that a group of penguins in water is called a raft.
