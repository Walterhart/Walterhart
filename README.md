### Hi my name is Walter Hart Jr

  I am a recent graduate from The University of Akron in Computer Science - Systems. Presently, I work  at 3C Digital Media Network as a Web Developer and Technical Support Personnel. I enjoy working with vanilla JavaScript, React, and Angular for the front end. For the back end, I like making APIs using Node.js. Other program languages I am efficient in are C++, Python, and SQL. I have worked with machine learning and AI algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vectors, Neural Nets, KNN, MDP, and Reinforce Learning. I also enjoy learning new frameworks. I am currently learning Arch Linux in my spare time to improve my knowledge about Linux. If you have any questions, feel free to message or email me at wally@walterhart.net

Fun fact: I love learning and interacting with animals.  I like animals such as dogs, cats, snakes, tarantulas, chickens, rabbits, and chinchillas.  My favorite animal is the penguin. I find it funny that a group of penguins in water is called a raft.
